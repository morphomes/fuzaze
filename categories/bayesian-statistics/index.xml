Let&amp;rsquo;s write a story. The main theme should tell and teach the reader about the difference between frequentist and Bayesiaan statistics approach methodologies. A philosophical and a deep approach would be more instructive. Let&amp;rsquo;s start.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Bayesian vs Frequentist Approach</title><link>http://localhost:8081/posts/2026-01-27-bayesian-vs-frequentist-approach/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 18:29:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:8081/posts/2026-01-27-bayesian-vs-frequentist-approach/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;To answer your question, we have to step into the shoes of a Frequentist and see the world through their lens—a lens of cold, hard repetition. Your intuition that frequency might be a &amp;ldquo;trap&amp;rdquo; touches on one of the deepest debates in the philosophy of science: The Problem of Induction.The Frequentist Fortress: Reliability through RepetitionIn a frequentist universe, &amp;ldquo;probability&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist for a single event (like a single coin flip). It only exists as the long-run limit. If you flip a coin 10 times, you might get 8 heads. But if you flip it 10,000,000 times, the frequency settles toward 0.5.1.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
