Your intuition that frequency might be a &amp;ldquo;trap&amp;rdquo; touches on one of the deepest debates in the philosophy of science: The Problem of Induction.The Frequentist Fortress: Reliability through RepetitionIn a frequentist universe, &amp;ldquo;probability&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist for a single event (like a single coin flip). It only exists as the long-run limit. If you flip a coin 10 times, you might get 8 heads.
